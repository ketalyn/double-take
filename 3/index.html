                                    I have always felt rather boisterous and gangly, being that I am 5ft 8, size 7 feet, never very ‚Äúgirly‚Äù, and felt I needed to show fractured sides of myself to different parts of society. However, this shoe, when I wear it, changes me. It changes the way I carry and look at myself. I am less aware of how I am walking. I feel smaller, more delicate in a way. Maybe it is the Velcro straps, or the innocence of the color white, but they make me feel young, small, very unlike me, but in a wonderful way.

                                    These are my walking boots that I‚Äôve had five or six years. I bought them when I was doing Duke of Edinburgh. I have worn them all over the UK, they have mud on them, cow dung, sick, everything on them. They are definitely not my favorite pair, but they remind me of a lot of fun stuff.

                                    I bought them in first year, I wear them pretty much every day still they are completely battered (so grim) but it means they are molded to my feet. They have two holes in the bottom which I‚Äôve superglued so I can‚Äôt wear them in the rain, but they have sentimental value after wearing them to Uni all the time and countless nights out, wearing them in New York and on holiday. They are a part of my identity, so I just feel myself when I wear them, they feel like home.

                                    These are definitely me because they are very fancy. When I put them on, they make me feel like a put together woman, confident, fancy and a lot taller, which is always helpful when you are 5ft 2. A put together woman means you walk around; you know what you are doing and your clothes and shoes reference that. You walk in a place you feel good in yourself, you feel confident, like your shoes can conquer the world.

                                    The pair of shoes that bonded me and my flat mate, (now close friend) Millie, on our first scary, awkward charity shopping quest in Nottingham. Having only known her a day, she found me these... in my size... for ¬£4. I‚Äôve worn them through every Uni adventure so far! They‚Äôve met new people with me, explored a new home, seen late nights and early mornings, danced with me, witnessed me laugh and cry and caused me to fall over a lot! So, they mean a great deal to me, and make the blisters worth it, for the memories that they hold.

                                    I bought these Nike White Air Force in my first term at Birmingham Uni. Everyone else was wearing them and I just wanted a pair for myself. I love the whiteness of them, and I always keep them clean. I keep them white with baby wipes and would never wear them out to a club. I bought them because it is what my friends have, and they feel like me.

                                    I brought lots of heels to university in my first term, but I didn‚Äôt wear any of them and ended up buying sneakers. I think the trainer look for me was about fitting into Uni, a kind of university identity.

                                    They are dead comfy. I have to be really careful to keep them white, so I wash my hands every time I put them on. Sometimes I have a pair of gloves in my bag that I put on before I take them on and off. They say I can work hard to save for something.
